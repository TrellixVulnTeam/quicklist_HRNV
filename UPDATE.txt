1) When items fail to cast I should take any info that was 
found and ask users if they would like to upload the rest 
manually - Huge time commitment // instead I will make edit controls in item page more visible


2) When items fail to connect need to timeout  - DONE

3) Change lists to show newly added first - DONE

3.5) Loading should probably be clearer - DONE


5) Every user should have a preset list - For now, created example URL in public item


-STILL NEED TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT--

4) Update styling
6) Implement speed dial in items page
